    "### About Me:\n",
    "I'm a Frogtown resident, community advocate, programmer. I will like to use open-source data to be share stories and create action. Please follow me on [Github](https://github.com/sustainabu) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently in the United States, there is alot of tension between law enforcement, and the public. I will be looking into the Traffic Stop Data for Saint Paul, Minnesota (USA) provided by the Saint Paul Police Department (SPPD). Analyzing the traffic stop data can provide evidence (or lack thereof) of systemic biases. The goal of my report to add insight on what is happening in my community, Thomas-Dale neighborhood aka Frogtown, as well as advocate citizens to use open source data and/or demand their public agencies to provide such data. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Executive Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain parts of Frogtown that have greater frequency of traffic stops compared to rest of the neighborhood, particularly along University University Avenue.The data **suggests** targeting of Black drivers given that they are stopped more frequently, searched more frequently per stop, and less likelihood to receive a citation. Some other data insights include that moving violation stops are given mostly in the morning and have a higher citation rate. In contrast, during the late night hours, there are greater instances of equipment violations. Furthermore, there seems to be many communities, including Frogtown that have considerable instances of equipment violations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why prove the obvious?\n",
    "\n",
    "The results may be obvious, but proving it may be more challenging. As a researcher, my goal is to measure the impact, seek the truth, explore, and challenge my expectations. Data can be the great equalizer challenging our worldviews and/or reinforcing our existing perspective. Data reports can be used to share stories and information effectively. Furthermore, data is used as an evaluation tool to determine the effectiveness of programs and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus data practitioners, more broadly institutions, hold strong responsibility and influence in shaping the data in support a certain narrative. In our current political climate, the public perception on law enforcement is polarized and I hope these studies can shed light on the issues. This report and other will be available via open source, allowing others to contribute, replicate, use code for their own respective neighborhood.\n",

    "## About Saint Paul\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Saint Paul is the second largest city in Minnesota, USA, and is the capital city for the state. Saint Paul is often paired with their nearby city, Minneapolis, where they are aptly named, The Twin Cities. It has roughly over 300,000 people and the city itself is quite diverse. Minnesota has a high level of [racial inequity](http://www.citypages.com/news/minnesota-still-has-some-of-the-worst-racial-disparities-in-the-nation/504390741) ranking 47th of 51st compared to rest of the United States. Saint Paul is broken down to seventeen Planning Districts, created in 1979 to allow neighborhoods to participate in governance and use Community Development Block Grants. The Thomas/Dale neighborhood is one of the district planning councils. A few years ago, a tragic police shooting occurred during a traffic stop in the suburbs of Saint Paul, Falcon Heights, which has increased tension within the community between law enforcement and citizens. \n",

    "## About Thomas-Dale-Frogtown Neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "The Frogtown community has historically been a transitional community with new immigrant/refugee communities living in the neighborhood for short period of time. From my experience, Frogtown boasts considerable diversity respect to language, culture, and ethnicity. In recent times, it has been historically poor. Here is a snapshot of the community  exported from [Minnesota Compass](https://www.mncompass.org/profiles/neighborhoods/st-paul/frogtown-thomas-dale) based on 2017 Census Demographic Data.\n",

I will emphasize more noticeable landmarks once plugging in the 4-square data. The two rightmost sectors are respectfully Mt. Airy and Capitol Heights.

    "After digging into the data, we get a better grasp on how traffic stops are administered and the citation rate. Within Frogtown, the data shows that movement violations are more frequent during the daytime, which have a high citation rate. During late night, equipment violation is more frequent in the community. When expanding outward to the Saint Paul, we see that traffic stops are more frequent along university avenue, which is both commerical and the light transit runs through the avenue as well. The Frogtown area have more traffic stops than their neighboring community, with greater concentration from Western Ave to Lexington Ave. Within Saint Paul, there are similar communities like Frogtown.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In regards to the racial question within Frogtown, Black and White drivers are over-representated, while Asians are under-representated for total citations given. Black drivers are at least twice more likely to be searched than their white counterparts for moving violations, despite having low citation rates. During the late night hours, black drivers are more likely to be stopped and have greater rates of moving violations. On the other hand, white drivers have greater citation rate during the morning time. Within gender, white female drivers get stopped. Though it's worth nothing that this can be due to the wealth gap between different racial lines. At the city level, we see that black drivers are over-representated on total traffic stops in all neighborhoods. On contrast, Asian drivers are under-representated respect to total traffic stops.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This report created more questions than answers. Why is there discrepancies in the data? What is the criteria for an equipment violation; does crashes count? There is simply not enough volume of 911 calls and invesitgative stops to account for the imbalance.\n",
